            <p>I am a <u>Frontend Engineer</u> with <u>over 6 years of experience</u> building clean, scalable, and high-performing web applications. I graduated as a Computer Systems Engineer back in 2018, and since then, I have worked on a wide range of projectsâ€”everything from static websites and e-commerce platforms to admin dashboards and email templates.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I have had the chance to work in both small teams and larger setups, often collaborating directly with designers, backend developers, and clients to bring ideas to life.</p>
            <br />
            <p>These days, I am working remotely with a US-based company, where I focus on building responsive, accessible UIs using HTML, SCSS, React, and Next.js.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I love solving problems with clean code, building reusable components, and making sure every design looks great on any screen. Whether it's leading a frontend architecture or helping content teams move faster with custom CMS components, I am all about creating smooth, user-friendly experiences.
